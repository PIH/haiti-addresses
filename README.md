It's possible this will never be needed anymore.

These files were migrated from subversion without history.  Haiti address hierarchy was 
created in March 2012 for Lacolline and then eventually the address hierarchy file 
was added to the OpenMRS Mirebalais module. 

It is described here:  https://tickets.pih-emr.org/browse/HAI-508

* The script was written by Evan Waters and modified by Ellen Ball.  
* Brittany Eddy and MEQ were the source for the data.
* The current version we are using in Mirebalais is stored in git as part of the mirebalais metadata module.
* The latest "master" version of the hierarchy should be in Dropbox and managed by MEQ, but I haven't looked at this in quite some time.
* assumedly MEQ has master copies of these files somewhere as well.
